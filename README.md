# 6885_Final_Project

### Experimental Scenarios

The experiments were conducted in three progressively complex scenarios: the basic Snake game, a single-agent *Slither.io* environment, and a multi-agent *Slither.io* competitive environment. 

The basic Snake game environment was based on the open-source project [DRL4SnakeGame](#DRL4SnakeGame), which provides a standard implementation of the Snake game. For the *Slither.io* environments, both single-agent and multi-agent setups utilized the open-source project [Snek](#snek), a clone of the original *Slither.io* game. These projects served as foundational environments, which were adapted to integrate reinforcement learning capabilities. 

Consistent configurations were maintained across all scenarios to ensure reliable comparisons.
